            <img class="profile-pic" src="assets/images/IMG_1142.JPG">
            <p>I was born in Georgia, grew up in south New Jersey. I took up an interest in science and physics in particular, and after graduating high school, I attended college in Boston and graduated with a degree in Physics, specifically Astrophysics.</p>
            <br>
            <p>After graduating, I moved to the bay area where I had a job in pulsed power science, and then my current job at a San Francisco tech company. I'm a tier 3 support agent and have traveled to Seattle and Israel for work.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I was raised on rock music and videogames, and have played the guitar since my senior year of high school. I also am an obsessive Monty Python fan and have taken a recent interest in history, particularly of the first world war (100 years ago today!). As a party trick, I can tell you who the president was any year after 1788.</p>
